In games, it is typically responsible for\n * computing physics and AI as well as drawing the result on the screen.\n *\n * The body of this particular loop is run every time the browser is ready to\n * paint another frame. The frequency with which this happens depends primarily\n * on the monitor's refresh rate, which is typically 60 frames per second. Most\n * applications aim to run at 60 FPS for this reason, meaning that the main\n * loop runs about once every 16.7 milliseconds. With this target, everything\n * that happens in the main loop (e.g. all updates and drawing) needs to occur\n * within the \"budget\" of 16.7 milliseconds.  See\n * `MainLoop.setSimulationTimestep()` for more information about typical\n * monitor refresh rates and frame rate targets.\n *\n * The main loop can be started and stopped, but there can only be one MainLoop\n * (except that each Web Worker can have its own MainLoop). There are four main\n * parts of the loop: {@link #setBegin begin}(), {@link #setUpdate update}(),\n * {@link #setDraw draw}(), and {@link #setEnd end}(), in that order. See the\n * functions that set each of them for descriptions of what they are used for.\n * Note that update() can run zero or more times per loop.\n *\n * @class MainLoop\n */\nroot.MainLoop = {\n    /**\n     * Gets how many milliseconds should be simulated by every run of update().\n     *\n     * See `MainLoop.setSimulationTimestep()` for details on this value.\n     *\n     * @return {Number}\n     *   The number of milliseconds that should be simulated by every run of\n     *   {@link #setUpdate update}().\n     */\n    getSimulationTimestep: function() {\n        return simulationTimestep;\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * Sets how many milliseconds should be simulated by every run of update().\n     *\n     * The perceived frames per second (FPS) is effectively capped at the\n     * multiplicative inverse of the simulation timestep.

This approach suffers from the issue that it is\n     * dependent on the frame rate. In other words, if your application is\n     * running slowly (that is, fewer frames per second), your object will also\n     * appear to move slowly, whereas if your application is running quickly\n     * (that is, more frames per second), your object will appear to move\n     * quickly. This is undesirable, especially in multiplayer/multi-user\n     * applications.\n     *\n     * One solution is to multiply the speed by the amount of time that has\n     * passed between rendering frames. For example, if you want your object to\n     * move 600 units per second, you might write `obj.x += 600 * delta`, where\n     * `delta` is the time passed since the last frame. (For convenience, let's\n     * move this statement to an update() function that takes `delta` as a\n     * parameter.) This way, your object will move a constant distance over\n     * time. However, at low frame rates and high speeds, your object will move\n     * large distances every frame, which can cause it to do strange things\n     * such as move through walls. Additionally, we would like our program to\n     * be deterministic. That is, every time we run the application with the\n     * same input, we would like exactly the same output. If the time between\n     * frames (the `delta`) varies, our output will diverge the longer the\n     * program runs due to accumulated rounding errors, even at normal frame\n     * rates.\n     *\n     * A better solution is to separate the amount of time simulated in each\n     * update() from the amount of time between frames. Our update() function\n     * doesn't need to change; we just need to change the delta we pass to it\n     * so that each update() simulates a fixed amount of time (that is, `delta`\n     * should have the same value each time update() is called). The update()\n     * function can be run multiple times per frame if needed to simulate the\n     * total amount of time passed since the last frame. (If the time that has\n     * passed since the last frame is less than the fixed simulation time, we\n     * just won't run an update() until the the next frame. If there is\n     * unsimulated time left over that is less than our timestep, we'll just\n     * leave it to be simulated during the next frame.) This approach avoids\n     * inconsistent rounding errors and ensures that there are no giant leaps\n     * through walls between frames.\n     *\n     * That is what is done below. It introduces a new problem, but it is a\n     * manageable one: if the amount of time spent simulating is consistently\n     * longer than the amount of time between frames, the application could\n     * freeze and crash in a spiral of death. This won't happen as long as the\n     * fixed simulation time is set to a value that is high enough that\n     * update() calls usually take less time than the amount of time they're\n     * simulating. If it does start to happen anyway, see `MainLoop.setEnd()`\n     * for a discussion of ways to stop it.\n     *\n     * Additionally, see `MainLoop.setUpdate()` for a discussion of performance\n     * considerations.\n     *\n     * Further reading for those interested:\n     *\n     * - http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html\n     * - http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/\n     * - https://gamealchemist.wordpress.com/2013/03/16/thoughts-on-the-javascript-game-loop/\n     * - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Anatomy\n     */\n    numUpdateSteps = 0;\n    while (frameDelta >= simulationTimestep) {\n        update(simulationTimestep);\n        frameDelta -= simulationTimestep;\n\n        /*\n         * Sanity check: bail if we run the loop too many times.\n         *\n         * One way this could happen is if update() takes longer to run than\n         * the time it simulates, thereby causing a spiral of death.
